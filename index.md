Subscription| $0.44 | $0.05 | $0.04
Free        | $0.13 | $0.01 | $0.01

## Conclusions
* Recorded music is less than 1/3 of total revenue stream for musicians excluding
composers, classical, and jazz musicians
* Live performance is dominant revenue stream for musicians excluding
composers, classical, and jazz musicians
* Bandcamp may be best platform for distributing digital music sales by an
independent musician without strong label backing
